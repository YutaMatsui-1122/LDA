In this paper, we address the problem of detecting 3D objects from multi-view images. Current query-based methods rely on global 3D position embeddings (PE) to learn the geometric correspondence between images and 3D space. We claim that directly interacting 2D image features with global 3D PE could increase the difficulty of learning view transformation due to the variation of camera extrinsics. Thus we propose a novel method based on CAmera view Position Embedding, called CAPE. We form the 3D position embeddings under the local camera-view coordinate system instead of the global coordinate system, such that 3D position embedding is free of encoding camera extrinsic parameters. Furthermore, we extend our CAPE to temporal modeling by exploiting the object queries of previous frames and encoding the ego-motion for boosting 3D object detection. CAPE achieves state-of-the-art performance (61.0% NDS and 52.5% mAP) among all LiDAR-free methods on nuScenes dataset.
